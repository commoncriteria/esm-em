  <section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
    This document describes a core set of security requirements for Enterprise Security Management systems.  
    These requirements cover basic security characteristics and behaviors for an ESM management server. 
    <br/>
    <!--
    The intent is that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that highlight the relevant aspects 
    to be addressed by the Technical Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a narrative 
    that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, 
    and may elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level statements.

    <b>Enterprise  Security Management</b> is a Security framework designed to control the deployment, configuration and 
    monitoring of security policies on host agents across multiple platforms. It is a suite of product/product components 
    used to provide centralized management of a set of IT assets within an organization.

    <br/>
    The <b>Enterprise Security Management- Enterprise Management</b> module in the Enterprise Security Management Suite is a 
    centralized host system used to deploy software and manage systems across an enterprise. A service is deployed to 
    host agents and allow for the discovery, data capture, reporting and remediation of IT policy and security issue.

  <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
    [USE CASE] <b>Monitoring and Management</b>
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 1] Custom Events<br/>
    The ability to handle custom event management and monitoring across server and workstation endpoints.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 2] Standard Services and Alerts<br/>
    The ability to monitor multiple system services across endpoints, such as alerting for low disk space, 
    high memory usage alerts, account creations, accounts being added or removed from groups, services stopping.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 3] Patching and Policies<br/>
    The ability to deploy patches, security, and business policies to server and workstation endpoints, in addition 
    to deploying instructions to network configurable infrastructure devices.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 4] Discovery<br/>
    The capability to effectively browse, query, and export aggregated host-based endpoint data through a management 
    dashboard query interface, in addition to automatically add newly discovered endpoints to a monitored database.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE] <b>Expandability</b>
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 1] Vendor Expansion<br/>
    The ability to integrate and expand with additional vendor packages for custom monitoring and configuration of varying physical and virtual hardware.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 2] Resource Expansion<br/>
    The capability to generate performance and predictive analysis to estimate when a monitored resource will be exhausted and allow for administrators to plan accordingly.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE] <b>Security</b>
    <br/>
    The ability to function in any configuration of endpoints with or without agents in the following ways.
    <br/>
    <b>Agent</b>
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 1] Detection of Potential Unauthorized Activity
    <br/>
    The ability for agents to detect potentially unauthorized activity, software, or users by collection of 
    host-based endpoint data and reporting back to the management server for further analysis.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 2] Remediation of Malicious Activity
    <br/>
    The ability for the management server to instruct agents to perform remediation activities on the endpoints to cleanup detected 
    malicious activity and report back through secured channels.
    <br/>
    <b>Agentless</b>
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 1] Detection of Potential Unauthorized Activity
    <br/>
    The detection of potentially unauthorized activity, software, or users is enabled by remote collection of host-based endpoint data by the management server.
    <br/>
    [USE CASE 2] Remediation of Malicious Activity
    <br/>
    The ability to perform remediation activities on the endpoint remotely from the management server to cleanup detected malicious activity.

  <section title="Attacker access" id="attackeraccess"> 
    <ul>
      <li> An attacker is assumed to attempt attacks from the following vantage points: 
        <ul>
          <li> The network across which the application engages in communication, both actively and passively. 
            Including potentially IOT devices and BYOD. </li>
          <li> The platform on which the application is installed, though as an unprivileged subject. </li>
          <li> The endpoint (host agent) by planting crafted malicious artifacts on the Endpoint platform to be consumed by the ESM System. </li></ul></li>
      <li> An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of the application, its interaction with its host device or platform, 
        and/or the data it transmits over the network. </li></ul>

  <section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
    The following assumptions are made for the ESM product and its operational environment: 
    <ul>
      <li> Depending on configuration and capability, the product may or may not be: 
        <ul><li> Bound to directory server to support multi-user login </li></ul></li>
      <li> The ESM system is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving endpoint agent data. 
        Other entities on the network are not inherently trustable.</li>
      <li> Administrators are not malicious in nature. </li>
      <li> Users are not malicious in nature, though they may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behavior. </li>
