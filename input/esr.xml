	<section title="Background and Purpose" id="purpose">
		This document describes a core set of security requirements for Enterprise Security Management systems. 
		These requirements cover basic security characteristics and behaviors for an ESM management server or service 
		hosted in a cloud or on-premises (the ESM system).
		<h:br />
		The intent is that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that highlight the relevant aspects to 
		be addressed by the Technical Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a narrative that 
		introduces the reader to the problem being solved, and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and 
		may elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level statements.
	</section>
	<section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">
	  	This section is intended to provide the initial scope/bound of the security problem by providing the reader with 
		concise statements regarding the scenarios in which the technology is being used. The intended usage presented here 
		should lay the groundwork for the identifying the resources to be protected, and what threats must be considered in 
		the drafting of the Essential Security Requirements (ESR) and for the TC to consider when writing the PP.

		<!--Need to figure out how to format this properly -->
		[USE CASE 1] Detection of Potential Unauthorized Activity
		The detection of potentially unauthorized activity, software, or users is enabled by the collection of host-based 
		endpoint data to a central ESM where the data is analyzed.
		[USE CASE 2] Remediation of Malicious Activity
		The ability to initiate remediation commands to attempt a clean up of detected malicious activity is a key use case of ESM.
		[USE CASE 3] Discovery
		The capability to effectively browse, query, and export aggregated host-based endpoint data enables a SOC analyst to 
		discover adversaries in post-compromise scenarios.
	</section>

	<section title="Resources to be protected" id="resourcesprotected">
    	  <ul>
	    <li> Sensitive data stored by the ESM system. </li>
	    <li> Credentials for authentication to or from the ESM system. </li>
	    <li> Cryptographic key material to perform secure communications with host agents. </li>
	    <li> Sensitive data in transit to or from the ESM system. </li>
	  </ul>
	</section>

	<section title="Attacker access" id="attackeraccess"> 
		<ol>
			<li> An attacker is assumed to attempt attacks from the following vantage points: 
				<ol>
					<li> The network across which the application engages in communication, both actively and passively. 
					     Including potentially IOT devices and BYOD. </li>
					<li> The platform on which the application is installed, though as an unprivileged subject. </li>
					<li> The cloud environment on which the application is installed, though as an unprivileged subject. </li>
					<li> The endpoint (host agent) by planting crafted malicious artifacts on the Endpoint platform to be consumed by the ESM System. </li></ol></li>
			<li> An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of the application, its interaction with its host device or platform, 
			     and/or the data it transmits over the network. </li></ol>
	</section>
	
	<section title="Essential Security Requirements" id="requirements">
	  	This is where the authors present an initial set of English requirements that specify security functionality, rather 
		than design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements will provide the foundation for which the 
		detailed set of requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements captured here make an attempt to 
		fully address the categories (e.g., access control, identification, authentication, management capabilities, roles 
		of administration, secure communications, and audit). That’s not to say the requirements are fully specified or 
		detailed enough to simply translate to Common Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
		is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections of this document, to provide the TC enough 
		information to ensure they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.

	<section title="Assumptions" id="assumptions">
	  Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
	  its	intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
	  will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.

	  The following assumptions are made for the ESM product and its operational environment: 
		<ol>
			<li> Depending on configuration and capability, the product may or may not be: 
				<ol><li> Bound to directory server or cloud environment to support multi-user login </li></ol></li>
			<li> The ESM system is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving endpoint agent data. 
			     Other entities on the network are not inherently trustable.</li>
			<li> Administrators are not malicious in nature. </li>
			<li> Users are not malicious in nature, though they may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behavior. </li>
		</ol>
